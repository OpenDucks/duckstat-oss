## Reporting a Vulnerability

How can I report a vulnerability?
Please write an email to github@duck-developing-studio.ga
It is important to us, that you exactly explain the vulnerability and if you can how you noticed that.

If your vulnerability is accepted, you'll get an email from us and we deploy a hotfix.
But if we decline it, we will do nothing, but you will get an information email from us, with the reason.

You can also reach out info@duck-developing-studio.ga for any other questions.
We are looking forward to support Version 1.2.2.x, but for now this version is not in use.
